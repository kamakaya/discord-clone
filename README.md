This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deployment

Tried deploying the application through Railway.app, but it kept crashing. Instead, I decided to dockarize it and deploy it directly through GCP.



## Technologies used

- **Framework**: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn
- **Database**: Prisma, MySQL, and Planetscale
- **Authentication & User Management**: Clerk
- **Realtime messaging**: Socket.io
- **Deployment**: Railway.app
